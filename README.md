# Fashion-Recommendation-System-Using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to develop a fashion recommendation system leveraging deep learning techniques and image-based analysis. The system involves:

Data Preparation: Extracting and preprocessing a dataset of fashion images from a zipped archive.
Image Analysis: Displaying and understanding image characteristics using Python libraries like PIL and Matplotlib.
Deep Learning: Utilizing pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16) to extract features and build an efficient recommendation engine.
Implementation Frameworks: Employing TensorFlow and Keras for model training and prediction.
The project combines state-of-the-art image recognition techniques to suggest relevant fashion items, enhancing user experience in e-commerce or fashion domains.
